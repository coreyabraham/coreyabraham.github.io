                <h2>Brief</h2>
                <p>Scurry is a 2.5D Puzzle Platformer developed with the Unity Engine that has you playing as a rat as you attempt to find salvation.</p>

                <p>
                    We had a lot of discussions as a collective team in regards to how this title was going to be produced and developed, as a lot of us in the earlier stages of developemnt didn't exactly know what this game would look and feel like.
                    In the end, we decided on 2D movement within a 3D environment since that would've been the easiest to convey to the Player without having to attribute for other factors that could've slown down the production of the game by a lot.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Fun Fact: The game during it's original planning phase had the intention of flipping the Player's perspective horizontally depending on what corner you turned at specific points of interest, 
                    this was however, cut pretty early on in the prototyping phase as the implementation of the early Player and Camera Systems proved this would've been difficult on a Programming and, more importantly, a Design stand-point.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The remains of this system, along with other tested features, are mostly still intact within the game's files themselves and can be found via the GitHub Repository linked at the bottom of this page,
                    most of the older branches have these prototype assets still burried within the Assets directory!
                </p>

                <h2>Contributions</h2>
                <p>
                    As one of two programmers (the other being <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshzurcas/">Josh Zurcas</a>), I was mainly responsible for the backend systems for the game as well as majority of the Camera System work, 
                    all of the User Interface programming and lastly helping out with odd Scripting related refinement every once and a while where it was needed.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Josh and I had a joint effort when it comes to the Player System and most of the work is balanced between us and the Camera System had some help from <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ethan-j-grigg/">Ethan Grigg</a> 
                    to make sure all the Unity math for the Camera logic when using Camera Zones was correctly written.
                </p>

                <p>MORE WILL GO HERE SOON!</p>
